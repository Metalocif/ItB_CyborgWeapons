Metabolize is a weapon added by this mod that deal 2 melee damage on an organic target with a weapon (ie. not Bots/Psions).
The weapon is then stored; subsequent casts let you use the stolen weapon as though Metabolize had its effects.
You can also self-target to get rid of the stored weapon as a free action.
I turn queued effects into instant effects, have a dumb hack to make the target area look decent, and make spawns be allies.
This is very tricky to code and some things don't work or won't work as you'd expect, especially with modded content.

Overall:
  - Webs immediately dissipate, but it's not like they'd do anything anyway.
In Vanilla:
  - The Spider boss, for some reason, does not have a weapon; you copy the alpha spider's weapon instead. Other bosses with no weapons (if they exist) should be handled the same way.
  - The Spiders spawns are not working in multiple, interesting ways.
  - Artillery weapons (scarab/crab) have a max range of 5. This is normal, that's how the weapon is defined.
  - The Gastropod sends a projectile, pulls, then dashes. The reason why is a mystery to me.
In Vextra:
  - the Anthill's weapon (alpha/boss version) spawns ants. The first is an ally, the second one is not.
  - the Termite's weapon does not work well, because it does a charge, which does not seem to mesh well with the targeting issue.
  - the Ice Crawler's weapon works. Shocking.
  - the Dragonfly boss' weapon does not do the T-shape blast unless there already was smoke on the tile. This is due to the way it is coded.
  - the Junebug's weapon will always use the powered version, since there will be no Ladybug on the map (unless you choose to enable it).
In Bots n' Bugs:
  - the enemy skills are hardcoded to only be usable by a creature of their type; they won't work. You can remove the checks in the code with little issue, though.
  - if you do, the Wyrm's attack bounces are not working in your favor.
  - I don't see a world in which the Floater is functional.
In Into the Wild:
  - Chompers should pull their target before attacking them; however, given stolen weapons have a range issue, you'll hit yourself if your target is not in melee.
  - Sunflowers don't work. Their multishot attack shoots forever. Fortunately, if you close the game, you won't have any issues.
  - Springseeds do work, except for the boss version (it leaps around a bunch)
  - As far as I can tell, Infusers do work, but why would you want that?
  - Buds don't work; they use a dumb hack that damages Copters, which is cleared by a script in the original weapon.
